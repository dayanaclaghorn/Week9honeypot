# Week9honeypot
Which Honeypot(s) you deployed?
Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP

Any issues you encountered
It was really difficult to set up the instance. It took me two days to fully deploy because the configuration was problematic. 
It was difficult to get gcloud to work with my computer because I use a Ubuntu subsystem at my terminal. Eventually I resigned to using cmd because if the simple intstation of the instance (which is probably a good learning experience.)
I ran into an issue when trying to ssh into the MHN admin-vm where I had insufficient permission to do most activities. 
I spent most of my time dealing with sysadmin issues, rather than actually learning the material.  

A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.
Number of attacks: 7892

Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected
I don't understand where to find which malware samples I collected.
I don't fully understand the attacks, but I think that will be remedied with time messing around with these honeypots.
I didn't fully understand what it was that I was doing when I was setting up my honeypot, so I feel like I didn’t learn much. Then when I ran into problems, it was more difficult to solve them because I didn’t fully understand what it was that I was doing. This will be remedied with time spent messing around with these honeypots after codepath is over.

Additionally, include a json export of the data you collected in the repo, instructions for which can be found in the next section.
